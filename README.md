# About-Me

Hi! My name is Jingxin Song and I'm currently an undergraduate student at the University of Washington in Seattle. I am a Statistics major with a Data Science concentration, and I have a minor in Business administration.

My coding experience comes mainly from school. I've taken a python class and a java class so far, where I've created a typing game with a team of other students (https://github.com/bucs110a0fall21/final-project-goggle). I also participated in a hackathon that was sponsored by my school, where my team and I created a music webapp that uses the spotify API (https://github.com/HomemadeToast57/doowop).
